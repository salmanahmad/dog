Ensure the proper ASTs

Handle TODO

Move "should_clean_tree" as a compilation rule ... maybe not...

How do communities and tasks and messages get created? Are they mapped (like functions) as well?

How are defined_variables handled? are they mapped (like functions) as well? 




Serialize the stack

Runtime tree traversal... (updating the "program counter")

What do things like "AccessHead" return and place on the stack?

What about non-primative stack placements like people? Do we need a language wide "json" serialization architecture...

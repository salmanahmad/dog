Ensure the proper ASTs

Add events, communities, messages, tasks

Remove old compiler crap

Handle TODO

Move "should_clean_tree" as a compilation rule ... maybe not...

Runtime tree traversal... (updating the "program counter")

What do things like "AccessHead" return and place on the stack?

What about non-primative stack placements like people? Do we need a language wide "json" serialization architecture...

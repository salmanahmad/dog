### Global data and records:

variable {
  name
  type
  track
}

When I create a person, do I save it in a normal array?

There are a couple of problems with this approach:
  Array size limitations (mongo for example can only save 16mb of data).
  Query and index the array.
  
Alternatives:
  Support "indexed collection" data type
  This create a mongo collection that actually can be queried
  The collections are scoped to a track - a variable identifies it.
  Expose a special api to all you to query this stuff...
  
### Relationships:

How do I store relationships?

 Usage: dog compile [FILE] [options]

   Will compile the file named FILE.dog into FILE.bark. The bark file
   can then be executed with 'dog run', 'dog start', or 'dog restart'.

 Options include:
   --jar 			  # Use the .jar extension instead of .bark for the output file
   --show-bytecode    # Show the compiled byte code instead. Useful for debugging purposes.

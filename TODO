  Routing

optional_arguments - function side
async call
	Internal functions have yield / return
		This proposal need much more work.
	
		Basically, return stops execution and returns - it does
		not actually return anything. yield is what returns stuff
		by adding to a special "@yield" variable. 
		
		yield 5
		yield 6
		yield 7
		
		is the same as:
		
		return 5,6,7
		
		A empty "return" on its own, does not actually push a null
		on the stack, it will just go ahead and return "@yield" - which
		by default is null
		
		So:
		
		return 5
		
		is the same as:
		
		yield 5
		return
		
		The one main problem here is how do I support automatically
		returning the value from the last expression? 
		
		do
			5 + 5
		end
		
		Perhaps one solution is that an empty return has different
		semantics from no return / return null. In other words, the first two 
		are the same but hte last one is different:
		
		do
			
		end
		 
		do
			return null
		end
		
		do
			return
		end
		
		

	External functions have to be re-written in the grammar
	so they create the default values for optional parameters
	and in addition they pass in the current_future_return_id to
	special framework function for "ask" and "compute". If these 
	functions recieve "null" as the future_return_id they obviously
	assume that the function is being called synchronously.


Plan:

	Async / Pending Structures
		Add additional properties to Value
			pending: {true | false}
			buffer_size
			channel_mode (allow_block, never_close, etc.)

		Add dog.pending_structure system call to create system call

		Update Access so that it blocks accordingly
			Pending collection
				structure_id
				value
				tracks
				handlers
			Inserts an entry into the pending collection
			Update track with the proper statuses
			Update the VM to respect those statuses

		Implement dog.add system call
			Dog structure numeric indices
			What happens if you are resuming a bunch of tracks but we crash before all of them hit a stable point?
			Implement ON EACH
			Invoke handlers

			Wake up tracks

		AsyncCall system call
			Update the VM so that when something finishes it closes the pending structure

		Implement dog.ask / dog.listen

		Web API
			Just accept the request and call dog.add, right?
			Figure out when to COMPUTE dog.add ON variables, close_me_type_message

	Predicates and Queries
		Just implement transform for predicates according to Mongo
		Implement dog.find

	Implement CRUD operators


	Access Scope Modifiers
		Properties
		Update compute and function calls to just use access - this paves the road for having dynamic properties for structures - think about collections and doing COMPUTE cars.type

	INCLUDE / Testing PACKAGE

	Calling Dog code from ruby - handling checkpoints, etc.
	


Things that are bothering me:

	Call and build use the stack to invoke functions - it feels weird to use "Access" to call a function
	Parameter passing for functions - Especially optional parameters with default values
	Access to the package name in the parser - Right now I am allow it but it does not feel right because the parser should not need to understand the semantics of the language. Consider being flexible in adding additional nodes. And determine where the "cut off" is. Obviously somethings (like for loops) are more easily done in the parser than the compiler because nodes are easier to work with than instructions.
	Nested function names / type names / access paths?
	Bootstraping the Type type
	External functions - how safe is my "custom method" solution like external_parameters
	Transpiling langauges: tamejs and coffeescript
	Can I compile down to JVM? Is it possible to have the asynchronous stuff *NOT* at the VM level. Basically, how much of Dog could I re-implement ontop of a general purpose programming language with good framework support?



Two special "types"
	Type "type"
	Function "type"
	
	You can invoke these with call and build.
	Byte code verifier
		Checks for duplicate functions
		Checks for types with multiple stuff

	How do I handle the persistence capabilities of Dog when calling a native function from the API?

"Macro System"

	Dog VM
		Symbol table organization:
			{
				name
				value: {
					type: function
					value: {
						name: <@naother_+symbol>
					}
				}
				implementations: [
					{
						catch_table,
						instructions:
						mandatory_arguments:
						optional_arguments:
						type: {human | machine}
					}
				]
			}
			
	
	
	build
	
	Create a small but complete set of "nodes"
		StructureLiteral
		StringLiteral
		NumberLiteral
		TrueLiteral
		FalseLiteral
		NullLiteral
		Assign
		Access
		Operation
		Branch
		Loop
		Break
		Call
		Return
	
	Down the road create instructions:

		Pop
		Push(value=null)
		PushString(value=null)
		PushNumber(value=null)
		PushTrue
		PushFalse
		PushNil
		PushStructure(type=nil)
		Access(path_size)
		Assign(path_size)
		ReadVariable
		WriteVariable
		Perform(operation)
		Jump(offset)
		JumpIfTrue(offset)
		JumpIfFalse(offset)
		Call(function, package, arg_count=0)
		Return
		Throw(name)


		
		# Pseudo instructions
		label(name) # nop
		seek(label, direction)
		
		Each node has a compile method and we call those recursively from the top.
		Each nodes returns an array of the instructions that it (and its descendants)
		compile down to. These are then combined by the parent, and recusively returned
		as you would expect.
		
		Once the instructions for the current function is over, I then scan over it and
		convert / replace any pseudo instructions. Right now, all this would be is seek.
		Seek will be converted to jumps with their jump distances computed at compile time.
		
		Consider adding an exception table (like JVM / YARV). This will handle
		exceptions as well as possibly provide a workaround for converting seeks.
		That is how YARV implements retry / next / break / throw. In which case, I may
		want to remove the "seek" command and instead implement a "throw" command
		instead. See: http://yarvinstructions.heroku.com/notes
		
	Re-write much of the syntax in terms of these nodes instead of creating your own
		There is no longer a While node, just a loop with a branch and break
		There is no longer an unless, just a branch that is re-written to be negated
		Etc.
		
	This it much easier to test, manage, iterate and optimize
	
	Issues:
	
		It may be hard to write the equivalent node structure for a given expression. I need some syntax to make it easier
	
		Can I have reused higher-level rules? For example, create a util expression by reusing a while expression instead of remaking it. I would need to expose a node to do that, right?
	
		How do I implement things like PRINT or LISTEN which need to do stuff. I would have to expose a node to do that, right?
			Pair stuff with functions. The PRINT expression should be a rewrite of COMPUTE print ON "val"
			This means that I need to make function calls VERY efficient
			
			Why would I want to do this?
				It keeps the VM simple and small
				It keeps the language core consistent without adding more
				Separation of UI (syntax) and backend (runtime)
		
		Add additional nodes only if you cannot do things as a function or for performance reasons (either function call overhead or node-rewrite overhead)
		
		General performance with stack and has_path, etc.






Virtual Properties

Macros
	Do I feel okay about macros and side-effects?

Criticisms of Dog:
	It is a new language (security issues, performance problems, lack of stability)
	The syntax is not the easiest or most conducive for building large applications - and do we have the property suitable abstraction capabilities?
	The lack of library support
	It is a special purpose language - however, it that purpose too broad or too constrained? What if I wanted to build something off the trodden path --- can I? Do I have low level enough support to do things like implement a bookmarklet or a TCP handling mechanism?
	Semantics --- are they useful? How hard will the client-side javascript be?

Pending structures
	- Are they able to be shared? How do you pass in a channel to another function for call backs?
	- Investigate the API with Go channels (especially timers)
	- Investigate the API with Python yield


Things left to implement:

	Import

	Communities

	Predicates

	External functions

	Implement unary operator

	Dog error reporting

	Dog unit test cases

	Add support for nested collections and nested functions inside of "ACCESS" - this would be the so called "cascasing" scope modifier.

	Update COMPUTE, ASK, LISTEN, etc to take an expression rather than just an identifier. Note: This does mean augmenting defintions with package information

	using @state instead of track.has_visited?

	Evaluator / Interpretter (related to bite code)

	Decide on anonymous functions vs blocks vs channels

Done:

	Organiation of the bite code and symbol table (filenames)

	System libraries (The ability to implement dog functions in Ruby)

	Scopes when ACCESSing

	Add a "type", "definition" or "symbol" structure to refer to definitions and box it as a value.

	Collections API

	People

	Null Pointer references for symbol look ups. Don't seem to be handled too well. Try to use system.add and it will not work.



Add unit parser tests for:
	import
	config
	
dog compile and dog run
	Extensions are optional..

Dog restart instead of Dog debug

Error codes
	Integration with a discussion page
	Integration with stack overflow
	Integration with a documentation URL

Abreviate file paths to relative paths in error message

Configuration file should be called:
	project.config
	
	Dog init will add in project.config
	
	Also consider including a read only CONFIG command to give access from within Dog
	
Line numbers should be formatted as:
	"In line {number} of {file}" rather than "file:number"

Right now we have static linked libraries (with import). We may want to introduce a capability to dynamically link as well... maybe?

Right now import will always import files relative to the current file. In this way it acts much like require_relative in ruby instead of plain require. We may want a way to add a non-relative import that uses a LOAD_PATH to use shared libraries in a common system location.

Potentially reorgnize the directory structure. Basically, reduce right now there are a lot of dependcies between the main folders.

Multiple VMs per process

Organize the symbol table hierarchically
	- Makes it easier to find stuff by the funciton scopes
	- Maybe something like this will work:
		symbols: {
			"foo": {
				"@path": [1,2,3]
				"bar": {
					"@path": [1,2,3,4]
				}
			}
		}







Add a package-level configuration functionality that also breaks out side effect rules and is linked to the project.config file? Useful for common things like file paths, or flags, etc.? Perhaps not writeable while the project is running, but at the very least standardized for package developers.










Ruby API (similar to the C api for ruby)
	Perhaps an "Init_MODULE_NAME" function that manipulates the AST (or perhaps just manipulates the function map...)

How do you "require" a C module in ruby and what woudl that look like for Dog???
	Do these do what we expect: "require 'hello'" vs "require 'hello.so'" vs "require 'hello.rb'"
	Should we have the similar approach???

functional languages
	Everything in the language is immutable
	
	Objects / Methods exist from a syntax standpoint
	
	Manipulating an object create a new version thus preserving immutability
	
	You can hold references to the same object but it is your "view" of the object
	
		You cannot "synchronize" an object down its timeline...
		
		It may not make a lot of sense for an object to store a value that does not compose it
		
	There is no "canonical" view of an object - just "your" view of the object
	
		You can however, check for identity and equality. Objects can:
		
			equal and identical
		
			equal but not identical
		
			not equal and not identical
		
			identical but not equal (aka different versions of the same thing)
		
	In Dog, we have a problem of wanting the public to see the "up to date" version of a resource --- but there i not way to merge different views.
	
		Perhaps we model the outside world as an actor that does have a "view" and that view is constructed by the event stream

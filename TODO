Ensure the proper ASTs

Handle TODOs

Right now we have static linked libraries (with import). We may want to introduce a capability to dynamically link as well... maybe?

Right now import will always import files relative to the current file. In this way it acts much like require_relative in ruby instead of plain require. We may want a way to add a non-relative import that uses a LOAD_PATH to use shared libraries in a common system location.

Organize the symbol table hierarchically
	- Makes it easier to find stuff by the funciton scopes
	- Maybe something like this will work:
		symbols: {
			"foo": {
				"@path": [1,2,3]
				"bar": {
					"@path": [1,2,3,4]
				}
			}
		}

Handle No such file errors with importing...

Handle error reporting with Dog commandline utility...

Fix the issue with expand_path if filename is empty ""

How does the runtime actually work?

Serialize the stack

Runtime tree traversal... (updating the "program counter")

What do things like "AccessHead" return and place on the stack?

What about non-primative stack placements like people? Do we need a language wide "json" serialization architecture...











Ruby API (similar to the C api for ruby)
	Perhaps an "Init_MODULE_NAME" function that manipulates the AST (or perhaps just manipulates the function map...)

How do you "require" a C module in ruby and what woudl that look like for Dog???
	Do these do what we expect: "require 'hello'" vs "require 'hello.so'" vs "require 'hello.rb'"
	Should we have the similar approach???

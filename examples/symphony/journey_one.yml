  came_to_toronto: I relocated to Toronto in August 2010 to accept a job in the city. Toronto is a world-class city with an amazing cultural community and civic identity, and I'm happy to call this city my new home.
  love_about_neighborhood: I love the activity of the city and the diversity of the people and neighbourhoods. I live in the Fashion district just west of the Entertainment district in an area with great restaurants, shops, and parks.

  came_to_toronto: My parents emigrated from India before my siblings and I were born.  They lived, for their entire time in Canada, in the suburbs of Toronto, but after we were born, they decided to move to a house in Markham that was right on the Toronto border, so that we could have easy access to the city.  I appreciated that opportunity and took full advantage of it while I lived there.  After attending university, I came back to Toronto for a job, but I was glad to have ended up here.
  love_about_neighborhood: I love that Toronto is made up of little neighbourhoods, each with their own culture and personality.  My current neighbourhood - I'm sort of in between Danforth Village and Clairlea, in Scarborough - is not my ideal place to live (it's what I can afford) but it's interesting nevertheless.  It's very ethnically diverse, but unlike neighbourhoods like Little Italy or Koreatown or Gerrard St. which have a solid core of a major ethnic group, my neighbourhood seems to have a bizarre melange of little communities, the ethnicities you never really see in large numbers anywhere else.  There's a lot of young families, a lot of single professionals like myself, and few of any other types of people.  If nothing else, it's pretty friendly; the sounds of children playing in the park behind my building is heartwarming, even if it's early on a Saturday morning.

  came_to_toronto: I moved here in 1962 from a small town in northern Ontario. I came here to attend university, the first in my family to do so. I've stayed because I've always wanted to live in a big city and because there are more work opportunities here for journalists (I'm freelance) than anywhere else in the country. As a gay man, I value the acceptance that has grown so remarkably over the years.
  love_about_neighborhood: I live in the gaybourhood, and it can feel like a village It has its eccentrics and its irritants, its kindnesses and cruelties, its nonsense and its passion for both partying and social justice.

  came_to_toronto: My dad's family is Japanese-Canadian, originally from the west coast.  During WWII, they were sent to an internment camp, and then were forced to either go back to Japan or move further east.  They decided to go east, moving to Toronto, where my mom's family had moved to from Quebec a few generations back.  That's where they met, and I've grown up in the Toronto area.  I stay because I feel like I wouldn't be able to call anywhere else HOME.
  love_about_neighborhood: I live in Riverdale in Toronto and work downtown.  I love the multiculturalism Toronto has to offer.  I love the old parks and streets, and also the new buildings and areas.  I love that you can get a little bit of everything.  I love the pride the residents take in the city.  I love the sports teams and the festivals and the culture and the lake and ... well, most things!

  came_to_toronto: |-
    I graduated from the University of Toronto, Faculty of Music....and the Opera School.  And sang with the Canadian Opera Co.  Although, I live in Boston at the moment, I am back almost every month to visit my children and the rest of my extended family.  
    
    I have watched with pride how the city has grown in every way.  The cleanliness of the city, and outward order, hide the great sense of human creativity which exists along side it.  
    
    The ferry boats to the island make the sounds of spring/summer.  The clock on the old city hall....and  chime towers that make sounds on the many churches.  The streetcars sounds has the creak along College st. are an intregral part of the "noise" of Toronto.

  love_about_neighborhood: Forest Hill.....a very pretty and quiet neighbourhood in which to live.  Where I lived and visit where my children live.

  came_to_toronto: My grandmother arrived in Toronto in 1910 on a boat. She was 10 years old and her parents were coming to stay with friends that had left England the year before. My father's family arrived in Toronto in the late 1920's with 4 children and he was the first child born in Toronto. Their family was complete when they had 10 children. So I'm 2nd generation Torontonian. I married an American and have lived in both countries, but always end up back in Toronto. And my son decided that he wanted to stay in Toronto and is now at U or T. 
  love_about_neighborhood: I love the diversity of the city. You can travel a few blocks and go from greece to India to Britain. I grew up in Bennington Heights, and manby of the old gang are stilll in touch even though people now live all over the world. It's still the old gang and we remember the things we did like it was yesterday. There is always something happening, and always a surprise. You might awaken to the sound of bagpipes, or kids playing in the park.

  came_to_toronto: My husband and I moved to Toronto about a year ago, from another province in Canada. We came here because it is a city full of opportunity (especially for my husband's career). At first it was overwhelming because it was much bigger than the city we came from. I had a hard time at first figuring out how I fit into the fabric of everything that was going on around me, but before long, I started to carve out a niche for myself, make some friends, find work and develop my routines. Now it feels like home.
  love_about_neighborhood: My neighbourhood is a GREAT! Primarily, semi-detached homes that have been converted into multiple family dwellings. There are a lot of homes that have the owners living on the main levels with renters living in the basements and second stories. There are multi-generational families from babies to grandparents. There are students. There are twenty- and thirty-somethings. There are construction workers, lawyers and business owners. On warm evenings, the people in the neighborhood sit on their front porches and converse across the street. Kids ride their bikes and scooters up and down the sidewalks and people say hi as you pass them on the street. At either end of the block are bustling streets full of restaurants, independent shops, bakeries and all sorts of places to have coffee. People care about this neighbourhood and it shows.

  came_to_toronto: I was born in Toronto, but plucked from the city at the age of 9, when my family moved to Saskatoon. I immediately missed the the T-dot, and on annual trips back, relished the approach to the city along the Gardiner. I also loved the city's energy, subway, craning my neck to view skyscrapers, and that my extended family was here. My move back to Toronto was gradual, and I eventually stayed because of family, connections forged while studying at U of T, great neighbourhoods and opportunities in the arts.
  love_about_neighborhood: There is no season that doesn't suit the Annex. The Annex draws people out of doors, to parks, terraces, sidewalk vendors, bicycles, and short walks leading to ambiences to suit every mood. It's also a public transit hub, without the usual ugliness, so residents feel mobile and efficient.

  came_to_toronto: |-
    both my wife and I were born in toronto - coincidentally at the same hospital with the same doctor. She grew up in the northwest part of the city, I in the west end.
     
  love_about_neighborhood: Love the culteral diversity, eclecticism and Lake Ontario waterfront area. Living downtown at Bay and Davenport near upscale Yorkville business area. Currently much noisy construction on Bay Street. Most familiar sound byte is at the intersection of Bay and Bloor - "walk like a dog for all crossings..."  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XanqzKb-zuQ
